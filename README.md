__Note__: To distinguish terminal commands from words written in monospaced, outside a codeblock, we have use `$` character.

For example: To check the `hostname` run `$ echo $HOST` on terminal.

In the above example:
* `hostname` - is a monospaced word.
* `echo $HOST` - is a command.

__Note__: __`#`__ : Anything after it is comment. It may include terminal commands, but they can be just examples or to show outputs.
