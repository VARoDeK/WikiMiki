You change modes by pressing `ESC` (the escape key) to switch from any mode back to `Normal`
mode. From `Normal` mode, enter:

| `Visual` mode | `v` |
| `Visual` line mode | `V` or `Shift+v` |
| `Visual` block mode | `C-v` (`Ctrl-v`, sometimes also written `^v`) |
| `Command` mode | __`:`__ |

   - `>` to add a `tab`.

2) Press - `Shift+i`.
3) Enter you character.
4) Press - `Esc`.

### 4) - Search and replace.

```vim
:s/<regex-to-be-replaced>/<regex-to-replace-with>
```

__Case__: Search and replace first occurrence in each line in whole file. In `Command` mode:

```vim
:%s/<regex-to-be-replaced>/<regex-to-replace-with>

### 5) - Delete lines.

__Case__: Delete the current line.

2) Or, In `Command` mode:

```vim

```

__Case__: Delete 'n' lines from current. (Current line + 'n-1' following lines). In `Command` mode:

```vim
:d <n>
```

__Case__: Delete all lines in an entire file. In `Command` mode.

```vim

### 6) - Set (or Unset) flags after opening a file 'xyz'.

For example, you want to disallow 'write' and 'modify'. One way to do is to unset these flags while opening file:

```shell
vim -RM xyz
```

But since the file is already open, it can be changed here too. In `Command` mode, enter:

- `set nomodifiable` - to disallow modify.
- `set modifiable` - to allow modify.
- `set nowrite` - to disallow write.
- `set write` -  to allow write.
