# Resources for beginners in the field of Kernel Development.
## This is how I did it.

In my honest opinion, Kernel development is very easy. It's just that most people find it boring so that when they see anyone else doing it, they feel intimidated.

You just need to know how to build the kernel and do testing. Other than that, kernels are mostly written in C/C++/Assembly which are easy to learn languages.

### 1) - First things first.

* The C Programming Language - _book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie_.

* The C++ cookbook - _book by D. Ryan Stephens, Christopher Diggins, Jonathan Turkanis, and Jeff Cogswell_. (This book is not about C++, but how the projects are managed in C/C++)

### 2) - Learn what is Operating System.

* Video course - [Introduction to Operating Systems - by Georgia Institute of Technology : Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923).

* Modern Operating Systems - _book by Andrew S. Tanenbaum_.

* Operating Systems - _book by Avi Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin_.

* Operating System Concepts Essentials - _book by Avi Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter Baer Galvin_.

### 3) - Play with small Kernels.

* [UNIX Operating System source Code Level Six](http://v6.cuzuco.com/) __+__ [A Commentary on the sixth edition UNIX Operating System : by John Lion](http://www.lemis.com/grog/Documentation/Lions/book.pdf).

* [XV6](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2019/xv6.html) by MIT. It is a very very small and simple UNIX-like kernel developed for the sole purpose of teaching Operating Systems. There is also a video course by IIT Delhi - NPTEL teaching xv6, [visit course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBK2kWeXfoikzkFbQd4MXjtArzpoE8vmu).
