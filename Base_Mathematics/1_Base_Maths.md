# Base/Radix in Mathematics 

In mathematics, a base or radix is the number of unique different digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers.

## Decimal

The most common base system we use today is Decimal, which is Base-10. Hence it has 10 unique digits and letters,` '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' and '9'`, and their combination only is used to describe all the infinite numbers for this base system.

## What are numbers?

Numbers are the counts. It is simply how many objects you can count using unique digits and/or letters?

Number system can be made of any base/radix like Base-1, Base-2, Base-3, Base-4, Base-11, and so on.

Base-1 number system is the oldest and most primitive. In childhood, people are taught counting by drawing lines. One line means one object, 2 lines means 2 object and so on.

## Other Commonly used Base/radix number system.

* __Base-10__ (Decimal) means we can count 10 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-2__ (Binary) means we can count 2 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-2__ (Binary) means we can count 2 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-8__ (Octal) means we can count 8 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-16__ (Hexadecimal) means we can count 16 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

## Standard way to write a number in any base system?

Since the most commonly used base system is decimal. Hence, any number, say 44, is considered to be written in Base-10.

But the standard way to write any number _A_ with base _χ_ is: ___(A)<sub>χ</sub>___

Hence, 44, in decimal, will be written in standard way as: _(46)<sub>χ</sub>_ .
