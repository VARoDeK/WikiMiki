# Base/Radix in Mathematics 

In mathematics, a base or radix is the number of unique different digits and letters that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. 

---

## Decimal

The most common base system we use today is Decimal, which is Base-10. Hence it has 10 unique digits and letters,` '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8' and '9'`, and their combination only is used to describe all the infinite numbers for this base system.

## What are numbers?

Numbers are the counts. It is simply how many objects you can count using unique digits and/or letters?

Number system can be made of any base/radix like Base-1, Base-2, Base-3, Base-4, Base-11, and so on.

Base-1 number system is the oldest and most primitive. In childhood, people are taught counting by drawing lines. One line means one object, 2 lines means 2 object and so on.

## Other Commonly used Base/radix number system.

* __Base-10__ (Decimal) means we can count 10 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-2__ (Binary) means we can count 2 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-2__ (Binary) means we can count 2 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-8__ (Octal) means we can count 8 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

* __Base-16__ (Hexadecimal) means we can count 16 objects using unique digits and/or letters.

## Standard way to write a number in any base system?

Since the most commonly used base system is decimal. Hence, any number, say 44, is considered to be written in Base-10.

But the standard way to write any number _A_ with base _χ_ is: ___(A)<sub>χ</sub>___

Hence, 44, in decimal, will be written in standard way as: _(46)<sub>χ</sub>_ .

## How Counting Works (Decimal)?

The number-system was ofcourse not given by god. It is us who defines a system to count. Hence we defined some rules to give meaning to it.

Since the most commonly used base system is decimal, we will use this number system to explain the concept.

When there is no object, the count is `0`. Or write it as `00000` or `0000000` or `......00000000`. __The zeros, trailing towards left, doesn't signify anything, for any Base/radix system.__

* __The initial count is__ : _(..00)<sub>10</sub>_

* __Count 1 object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..01)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..02)<sub>10</sub>_ .
  
* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..03)<sub>10</sub>_ .
  
* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..04)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..05)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..06)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..07)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..08)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..09)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Since it is Base-10 number system, we used all 10 unique digits to count objects.
  
  _"When the current digit is the last digit of the base-system, to continue the counting, we make the current digit zero and increase the digit, just left to it, by 1. Repeat this process towards left."_.
  
  The number becomes _(..010)<sub>10</sub>_ .
  
  But then again continue with same digit.
  
* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..011)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..012)<sub>10</sub>_ .

  __.__

  __.__

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..019)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : 
  
  > When the current digit is the last digit of the base-system, to continue the counting, we make the current digit zero and increase the digit, just left to it, by 1. Repeat this process towards left.

  The number becomes _(..020)<sub>10</sub>_ .

  __.__

  __.__

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..099)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ :

  > When the current digit is the last digit of the base-system, to continue the counting, we make the current digit zero and increase the digit, just left to it, by 1. Repeat this process towards left.

  The number becomes _(..0100)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..0101)<sub>10</sub>_ .

  __.__

  __.__

* __Count 1 more object__ : Increase the digit. The number becomes _(..0999)<sub>10</sub>_ .

* __Count 1 more object__ :

  > When the current digit is the last digit of the base-system, to continue the counting, we make the current digit zero and increase the digit, just left to it, by 1. Repeat this process towards left.

  The number becomes _(..01000)<sub>10</sub>_ .

And this continues till infinity.

## Weights in a number system

Every number system has the concept of weights.

Weights give significance to the combination of dights and/or letters, used to write the count of objects. Weight of a digit/letter depends on its position.

Suppose we used decimal number system to count _(..046)<sub>10</sub>_ objects. Here `6` has weight the of 1. Whereas `4` has the weight of 10.
