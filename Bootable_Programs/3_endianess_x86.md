# Endianess

> In computing, endianness refers to the order of bytes (or sometimes bits) within a binary representation of a number. It can also be used more generally to refer to the internal ordering of any representation, such as the digits in a numeral system or the sections of a date.

> In its most common usage, endianness indicates the ordering of bytes within a multi-byte number. A big-endian ordering places the most significant byte first and the least significant byte last, while a little-endian ordering does the opposite.

> Little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures (x86, most ARM implementations) and their associated memory. File formats can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both.
